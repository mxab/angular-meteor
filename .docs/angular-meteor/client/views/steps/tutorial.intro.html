# Socially - A Meteor-Angular Tutorial App

This tutorial serves as a comprehensive introduction to writing applications with Meteor and AngularJS.

No previous knowledge in Angular or Meteor is necessary.

We will walk you through building an Angular-Meteor app. Can't wait to see it? Here's the final version - [http://socially-step18.meteor.com/](http://socially-step18.meteor.com/). Don't forget to come back and go through this tutorial!

You can also participate in our free angular-meteor university and do the step by step exercises together with community members.
Read more about the angular-meteor university [here](https://github.com/Urigo/meteor-angular-socially#angular-meteor-university-).

See how AngularJS makes the browser smarter, while making your application code smaller and easier. 

Also how powerful Meteor is, with it's Distributed Data Protocol (it's like "REST for websockets") and latency compensation.

We will also tap into the huge eco-systems of each of these frameworks. Which will allow us to write quality applications in a fraction of the time.

Our goal in this tutorial is to add more steps as we go along and to cover as many use cases as possible. So if there's a use case you think is missing, please suggest it on the [Github issues page](https://github.com/Urigo/angular-meteor/issues).

We also welcome pull requests for new chapters, we would love to work with you on them!

Enjoy!
